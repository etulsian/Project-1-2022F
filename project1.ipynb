As you might have studied in the reading assignments, genome assembly can get quite complicated, as problems such as full sequence coverage, finding a good length for reads (the $k$ in $k$-mer), and sequencing errors present challenges for sequencing analysis and accuracy. You can assume perfect coverage for all parts of the assignment and no read errors for the first two questions.\n",
